                        <p><strong>User Provided Data</strong></p>

                        <p>The App obtains the information you provide when you download and register within the App (hereinafter, “User Provided Data”). No personal information is requested through the registration process as mandatory in order to be able to use the basic features of the App. The registration process is currently intended for and directed to parents/grown-ups within the parent section of the App and utilizes Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)-compliant procedures to allow for the collection of certain account information from parents with verification of a parent year of birth. When you register with us and use the App, you generally provide (a) your name and year of birth; (b) information you provide us when you contact us for help.</p>

                        <p>Please note that certain sections of the App will ask for access to parts of your device – namely, the camera and the microphone. When you access these sections, a pop-up will ask you to allow the App permission to access the relevant parts of your device. You can adjust permissions given within the settings of your device itself. If you deny or remove this access, those sections of the App may not work fully as intended.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Automatically Collected Information</h2>

                        <p>In addition, the App may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system and language, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the App (such as information about your game progresses and activity) (hereinafter, “Automatically Collected Information”). The App may access certain device information and/or components automatically. This collection is only for the purpose of providing the services within the App you choose to use. This information is not linked to personal information about the user. A push notification token will be used to send push notifications to your mobile device with updates and suggestions upon request (e.g. through scanning QR codes) or automatically (e.g. by mean of audio watermarks). These notifications would only be activated from the parent section of the App and directed to parents.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Does the App collect precise real time location information of the device?</h2>

                        <p>This App does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the App?</h2>

                        <p>On a normal basis, only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Website and our service, e.g. maintenance and hosting services. We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

                        <p>We may disclose User Provided Data and/or User Automatically Collected Information:</p>

                        <ul>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Advertising</h2>

                        <p>We do not have any advertising in our App. At times, we may promote the App via internet advertising. If you click on such an advertisement on an external web site and navigate directly to the iTunes App Store or other platform, with the use of web cookie and similar technologies (You can refer to our <a href="https://www.ferrarausa.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> to learn more about opting out of such technologies) or non-identifying information such as your phone's device ID may be sent to the advertising network, so that they and we may track the effectiveness (i.e., conversions) of our advertising. In addition to conversion events, it might also be used for frequency capping, estimating the number of unique users, debugging, or security and fraud detection. When you use the App, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes. We don't store the ID, or share the ID or other unique information collected or used by the app with third parties, except for service providers whose analytics product generates this ID to track and analyze the performance and the quality of our App. We do not use information gathered within the App to serve you targeted advertisements.</p>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Data processor</h2>

                        <p style="list-style: none;">Ferrara has chosen Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) as the cloud service provider to store your data. The Article 29 Working Party (the independent advisory board made up of representatives from the data protection authorities of all the EU Member States as well as from the European Commission) has approved the AWS Data Processing Agreement, which includes the Model Clauses. The Article 29 Working Party has found that the AWS Data Processing Agreement meets the requirements of the Directive with respect to Model Clauses.

                        <p style="list-style: none;">Ferrara has chosen Google Firebase Crashlytics as crash reporting software to collect insights into the nature of stability problems you may face through some Automatically Collected Information. Analytics information are used to support Ferrara analysis and operations, to enable product development and to improve our APP and services.</p>
                        <p style="list-style: none;">Ferrara has chosen Gameloft SE as software developer for maintenance and for the improvement of the APP; it may therefore have access from time to time to some collected data.</p>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The backup of your Data will be stored on Ferrara’s AWS for as long as you use the App. If your account remains inactive for a consecutive period of 12 months, we will erase the backup of your Data.</li>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Children</h2>

                        <p style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">We do not use the App to knowingly solicit data from or market to people aged under 18. No personal information should be submitted by Children and their real name or any information should never be used in the feature of the App (such as the creation of an avatar). If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without their consent, they should contact us at webservices@ferrarausa.com. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time. If we were to collect and store personal information from children under the age of 18 in connection with a feature inside the App, we will first take steps to notify and obtain prior consent from a parent or legal guardian in accordance with applicable laws such as the COPPA, unless an exception to these laws apply. We would also give parents the ability to review their children's personal information, stop the further collection or use of such information, or request its deletion. To learn more about COPPA, you may consult this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program: <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html">https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html</a>.</p>

                        <h2 class="gl-legal-title">Security</h2>

                        <p>Information security is important to Ferrara and we are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We have established physical, electronic, managerial and procedural safeguards to protect the information we collect, process and maintain. These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure and improper processing of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our App. Please be aware that, although we endeavour to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>
